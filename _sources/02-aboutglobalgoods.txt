About Global Goods
##################################

Global Goods got its start as a Christmas season sale at First Congregational
Church in the 1990's.  The fair trade concept resonanted with church members and 
fit well with church's social justice missions.

When the church moved to 1000 South Cooper in 2000, we decided to devote space
to a fair trade store and Global Goods was born.  Today, we are open year round
on weekends and have a wide selection of fair trade goods including coffee,
chocolate, jewelery, clothing and accessories.
